### Goal:
Take pictures of other players without them knowing and try to avoid getting pictures taken of you!

### Sniping:
- All snipes must occur without the target knowing
  - Pictures must be snapped and sent to the correct channel before the target sees the sniper  
  - The target can deny the point if they have some proof that they knew  
  - This is heavily based on the honour system

- The snipe does not need to include the target's face, but the target must be recognizable
- If two or more players are together and send a snipe of the same target(s), only the first snipe sent will count
  - If two or more players are not together but happen to snipe the same target in the same location, they can all get the points
- A snipe including multiple players together counts as + point for each target in the shot
- The target may lose point(s) depending on the house rules
